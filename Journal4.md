# Week 4 2/11/21
I found the subject matter of this week to be particularly fun with the aspect of figuring out password lists and 
doing things related to using that list to brute force someone's login information.
Coming from a computer science major, there is quite a learning curve when it comes to doing things like using hydra, scanning,
and generating password lists. Fortunately these things aren't too foreign so once I get some experience with them, 
they start to make sense.
