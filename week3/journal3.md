# Week 3 - 2/4/22
This week I learned how to link my kali scripts with my github repo so that I can push the scripts.
This part was the most difficult for me as I was not aware that I needed to create the .ssh directory and
when I created the ssh key, I needed to do an ssh-add to make the key work on my kali box.
The main thing I learned this week was to work with and look up information using dns enumeration. [dns resolver](https://github.com/calrose/SEC335CR/blob/main/week3/dns-resolver.sh)
Another part of what I learned was doing some powershell scripting as that is something that I have never done before. [dns resovler powershell](https://github.com/calrose/SEC335CR/blob/main/week3/dns-resolver.ps1)
Another thing I learned to do is switch between tcp and udp with dns.
