# Week 6 2/25/22
I had a fair amount of struggles this week. The first one was getting the login necessary to become root on bios.
I knew it was pippin but I had a hard time getting the ssh login until I did peregrin.took. I was led to searching this because I noticed the other ssh users
had a firstname.lastname pattern. The next struggle was when I needed to use john the ripper to get the hashed passwords.
I didn't know what small.txt was supposed to be until I figured out it was a wordlist made from rockyou that grepped the usernames that I would need
(gandalf, galadriel, boromir). Overall the lab was very cool and fun even if I struggled a fair bit.

I'm pretty surprised to see the effectiveness of these password cracking tools even if this is a sort of artificial environment. It does make me worried with what hackers can do with their level of experince and skill using tools like these.
