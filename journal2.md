* Used commands like ping, fping, and nmap to find hosts and ips.
* Used wireshark to view the interactions with these commands.
* Used bash scripts to take the valid ips and put them in a text file.
* Observed the difference between running nmap normally and as super user.
* Used remote desktop services to connect my kali VM to my Windows VM.
