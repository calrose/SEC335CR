# Week 11 4/1/22
Lab 8.1 has me hard stuck due to needing to use a php agent so that I can utilize weevely on pippin
but out of all the methods I tried and resources I found, nothing worked. I feel like it would be easier 
if I knew how a php agent worke and what exactly it's supposed to do.
Lab 8.2 was straightforward to complete and using reverse shells to gain access was quite fun.
