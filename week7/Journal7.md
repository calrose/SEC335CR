# Week 7 3/3/22
This week was quite the struggle for me because I've never used things like ftp and while I'm currently learning mysql, it's not in a context like this and 
within the linux environment so I utilized the hint videos to figure out what to do there. 
I also had a hard time finding the password for peregrin.took until I realized that I missed the part in the LocalSettings.php file that contained that information.
