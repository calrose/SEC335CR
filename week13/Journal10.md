# Week 13 4/15/22
Lab 10.2 gave me some trouble as I was a little directionless after getting the IP and
port information. It was going relatively smoothly once I knew phpmyadmin was my next goal
but then I got stuck on finding where I could gain root access to the site.
This was a more self inflicted problem as the solution was me putting the 
commands that I wanted to use through my exploit that I found needed to be
in quotes otherwise they wouldn't work very well. Once I had that sorted out,
The rest of the lab was pretty smooth sailing and overall was quite enjoyable.
