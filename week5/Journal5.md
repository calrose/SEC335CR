On the topic of password security, I would say that my passwords are pretty hard to guess
as I have made sure to use pretty obsure words and character combinations.
I will say that I don't have a huge variety of passwords.
I think what I'm doing right is that I'm using hard to guess combinations of characters 
but I could maybe do a better job on having a variety of very distinct passwords.
