# Week 12 4/8/22
This week was a little more my speed cmpared to last because we were mainly working with SQL command injections.
I have some familiarity with MySQL since I'm currently taking a class with it and while that 
isn't the exact same as what we tackled in this class, the knowledge still has enough carryover.
Lab 9.1 was fun since it guided me in how SQL can be used to gather information from a website's 
database through using commands in the search bar.
Lab 9.2 was pretty smooth for me except for when I reached the part where I needed
to find a vulnerability to the site. Once I was told that the front page of the site
is a good starting point and after being told that part of the assignment uses SQL injection
and that the site is real and that other people have likely looked into eploiting it,
I was able to get through it no problem.
